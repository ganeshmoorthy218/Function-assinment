        "#### **Define:**\n",

        "\n",
        "### 6. **Recursion (Function Calling Itself)**\n",

        "\n",
        "### 7. **Function with a Return Value**\n",
        "A function can perform operations and return a result, which can be used later.\n",

        "print(result)  # Output: 16\n",

        "\n",
        "### Summary of the different ways to define and call functions:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Example of an iterator**: An iterator is an object that implements two key methods:\n",

        "  \n",
        "When `__next__()` reaches the end of the sequence, it raises the `StopIteration` exception.\n",

        "### **Generators in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "A **generator** is a special type of iterator in Python that allows you to iterate over a sequence of data, but unlike regular iterators, it doesn't store all the items in memory at once. Instead, it **generates** items one at a time and **lazily** yields them as they are requested. This makes generators very memory efficient, especially when working with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts:\n",
        "1. **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators compute the next value only when needed. They don't generate all the values upfront.\n",
        "2. **Stateful**: Generators maintain their state between each yield, which allows them to continue where they left off when `next()` is called.\n",
        "3. **Yield**: The `yield` keyword is used to produce a value from the generator function and pause the function's execution, allowing the generator to be resumed when the next value is requested.\n",

        "def count_up_to(max):\n",

        "    while count <= max:\n",

        "print(next(counter))  # Output: 3\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the function `count_up_to()` defines a generator that yields numbers from 1 to `max`. Each time `next()` is called, the function resumes from where it last yielded and continues until the condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Generator Expression**\n",
        "A generator expression is similar to a list comprehension but returns a generator object instead of a list. It's enclosed in parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The goal of using `reduce()` in this case is to **accumulate** the values in the list to get the sum. We will apply the function `lambda x, y: x + y` cumulatively to the elements of the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initial Values**:\n",
        "   - The list of numbers: `[47, 11, 42, 13]`\n",
        "   - The function: `lambda x, y: x + y`\n",

        "   - The function `lambda x, y: x + y` is applied to these two values:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     x = 47, y = 11\n",
        "     result = 47 + 11 = 58\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - The result `58` will be used in the next iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Second iteration (Using the result from the first iteration)**:\n",
        "   - The result of the first iteration `58` becomes the new `x`, and the next number in the list is `42` (the second element).\n",
        "   - The function is applied again:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     x = 58, y = 42\n",
        "     result = 58 + 42 = 100\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - The result `100` will be used in the next iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Third iteration (Using the result from the second iteration)**:\n",
        "   - The result from the second iteration `100` becomes the new `x`, and the next number in the list is `13`.\n",
        "   - The function is applied again:\n",
        "     ```\n",

        "\n",
        "### Illustration of the Steps:\n",
        "```\n",
        "1. Iteration 1: 47 + 11 = 58\n",
        "2. Iteration 2: 58 + 42 = 100\n",
